# spring_boot
Used for creating standalone Spring based applications easily. Spring is an application framework - handling Http requests, connnecting to databases ( RDBMS, MongoDB ), running queries etc.

# Problems with Spring
1. Huge framework
2. Lot of steps involved
3. Configuration steps
4. Multiple build and deploy steps

These steps are abstracted via Sprint Boot.
